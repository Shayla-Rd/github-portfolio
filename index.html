    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about" class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions. My journey began at Eleanor Roosevelt High School, where I participated in the Science and Technology Program. This program sparked my interest in engineering and laid the foundation for my career path.</p>
        <p>This program fostered my passion for science and engineering, providing a rigorous foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical problem-solving. During my junior and senior years, I had the privilege of participating in a research practicum, which allowed me to apply my academic learning to real-world scenarios.<p>
        <p>In addition to the practicum, I secured an internship at the Howard University Beltsville Campus, where I worked alongside a team of researchers in the field of environmental science. My primary focus was on studying the flow of particulate matter in Bolivia, a project that involved extensive data collection and analysis. This internship provided me with firsthand experience in environmental research, where I explored the intersection of mechanical engineering and sustainability. It also enhanced my understanding of how engineering solutions can mitigate environmental issues on a global scale.<p>
        <p>Through this hands-on research experience, I gained invaluable insights into the challenges of designing systems that promote environmental sustainability. The exposure to real-world applications of mechanical engineering deepened my interest in sustainable engineering practices and reinforced my commitment to finding innovative solutions to environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Currently, at Cornell, I am honing my skills as a mechanical engineer, participating in various design projects that challenge me to think critically and creatively. I am passionate about contributing to engineering solutions that make a positive impact on society, and I look forward to further developing my skills in the field.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Research Internship at Howard University Beltsville Campus</h3>
            <p>During my internship at the Howard University Beltsville Campus, I was part of a research team focused on studying the flow of particulate matter in Bolivia. This environmental research project allowed me to apply my engineering background to real-world sustainability issues. I participated in data collection, analysis, and environmental monitoring, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved in creating sustainable engineering solutions for global environmental issues.</p>
            <p>This internship gave me invaluable insights into the role of mechanical engineering in addressing environmental problems, particularly the design of systems that help monitor and mitigate air pollution. It deepened my appreciation for the intersection of technology, sustainability, and global impact, shaping my future aspirations as an engineer committed to creating solutions that prioritize environmental well-being.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>TidyTwist: Portable Liquid Dispenser</h3>
            <p>TidyTwist is a TSA-approved portable liquid dispenser designed to address the common challenges travelers face when transporting toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The goal was to create a compact, user-friendly, and durable dispenser that complies with TSA regulations while ensuring ease of use during travel.</p>
            <p>The dispenser features a rotating mechanism that allows users to easily access the desired amount of liquid, ensuring efficient dispensing with minimal mess. The rotating mechanism was carefully designed with ergonomics in mind, making it intuitive to use and reducing liquid wastage. A key challenge was designing the dispenser to accommodate standard liquid sizes while maintaining a compact form that would easily fit within carry-on luggage restrictions.</p>
            <p>Throughout the design process, I prioritized material durability, leak-proof seals, and ease of cleaning. TidyTwist is made from lightweight, BPA-free plastic, ensuring both portability and safety. Additionally, I focused on creating a design that could withstand the pressure and movements typical of travel, ensuring the dispenser remains functional throughout its use.</p>
            <p>During development, I tested several iterations to refine the mechanism's functionality and confirm the scalability of manufacturing. One of the main challenges was preventing leaks, which I addressed by incorporating a silicone gasket around the dispensing nozzle. This solution ensures that the dispenser remains secure and operational, even during rough handling in transit.</p>
            <p>This project strengthened my skills in product design, material selection, and testing. It also reinforced my understanding of user-centered design principles, emphasizing the importance of creating practical, efficient solutions that cater to real-world needs.</p>
